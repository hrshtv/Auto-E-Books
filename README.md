# AutoLibGen

(Currently under development)  

A simple automated python script that downloads the torrent file for any E-book present on [Library Genesis](https://libgen.is/) by accepting an approximate title of the book as an input.  

To do:  
- Search titles of top 5 items in the results to find best match
- Enable a functionality for automatic conversion of .torrent files to .pdf
